# Component based local filesystem image finder
The purpose of this app is to integrate many external components into one REST based application that allows to browse local directories for images that fullfil certain criteria. The app will be distributed along a few instances that share the load of image processing and communicate via REST. Besides the backend search architecture app also features a web based interface for defining the search criteria and displaying the results. The project is developed for the "Techniki Komponentowe" class at AGH Uuniversity of Science and Technology.


# Some example criteria would be:
 - **Metadata** - when was a photo taken, who took the photo
 - **Contents of an image** - Does the image contain people? Does it have any plants in it?
 - **Text** - Find images containing certain text.

# Graphical interface
**TODO**

# Backend architecture
**TODO**
